# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Example
The purpose of this R script is to demonstrate a Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). This was made mostly for my own reference
and a way to practice these functions, so it is far from perfect or comprehensive.
However, I will share it for others who may find it helpful.

PCA is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of datasets, 
by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance.
I often use PCA when wanting to combine correlated variables into a 
single variable, which is helpful for avoiding mulitcollinearity
when doing regression analysis.
